Chef-Berksfile-Env
==================

A Chef plugin which allows you to lock down your Chef Environment's cookbook versions with a Berksfile.

Installation
------------

    /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install chef-berksfile-env

Usage
-----

In your chef repo create a Berksfile next to your Chef environment file like this,

    chef-repo/environments/[ENV_NAME]/Berksfile

This is the default location that will used by the plugin. We have to put the Berksfile in its own
directory since [multiple Berksfiles can't exist in the same directory](https://github.com/berkshelf/berkshelf/issues/1247). 

The berksfile should include any cookbooks that your nodes or roles explicitly mention for that environment,

    source "https://supermarket.getchef.com"

    cookbook "java"
    cookbook "yum", "~> 2.0"
    ...

Next we need to generate our Berksfile's lock file,

    berks install

Your environment file must by in `.rb` format and look like this,

    require 'chef-berksfile-env'
    
    # The name must be defined so we can use it to find the Berksfile
    name "my_env"
    
    # Load Berksfile locked dependencies as my environment's cookbook version contraints
    load_berksfile

    ...

Now our environment will use the locked versions of the cookbooks and transitive dependencies generated by our Berksfile. 
Upgrading to the latest dependecies is now as simple as,

    berks install

Our Berksfile also provides an easy way to ensure all the cookbooks and their versions that our environment requires 
are uploaded to our chef-server,

    berks upload
